Assignment 1: Message Padding and Disassembling
Due Date: Feb. 5, 2021
- The purpose of this program is to create a 3 layer protocol that will receive a message and split into chunks if need
    be through each layer, spitting out a new message as it goes through the function.


How to use:
1. Log ask where you want to read from - you type in src/Message.txt
2. then the input which is src/ProtocolSpecification.txt
3. Information should then pass through the protocols and outputs message
4. To test other values, manually input the values into the layer methods

Note: I had issues with creating the splicing for the messages and was unsure how that should work, I tried to find
examples online and found nothing but socket coding which I do not feel is relevant to the assignment. I would definitely
be curious once the deadline is done to see how this code is created and the process.
