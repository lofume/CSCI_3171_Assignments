* THIS PROGRAM SHOULD RUN THE CRC CHECK USING MODULO 2 ARITHMETIC IN ORDER TO TAKE IN
*   THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE AND CONVERT IT TO THE CRC CODEWORD.

How to use:

The system works to take input specifically from the "MessageAndPolynomial.txt" document, modifications
    to the document should be made accordingly and converted in the code if file name is different.
    Run the code with test cases from the txt file. The resulted CODEWORD SHOULD BE CORRECT IF THE
    CORRECT VALUE FOR THE FIRST POSITION IS "1". IF NOT AN ERROR WOULD OCCUR.
